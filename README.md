## Features✨
- Add or remove colors to customize your drawing

## Installation💻
- to run this project, you need Python installed on your machine

## How it works🔍
- first, it will ask if you want to add, remove, or simply draw using the default list of colors.
- you can add colors to the existing list, and they’ll be used for drawing
- you can remove colors from the default list
- if the color you wanted to remove isn’t found, the program will let you retry or proceed with the remaining colors
- if all colors are removed, the program will exit, as no shapes can be drawn without colors
- the turtle will draw a polygon where each side is painted with the colors from your list
- the program crashes if invalid input is entered
